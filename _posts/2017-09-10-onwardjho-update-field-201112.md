On December 24, 2004, I walked into a youth hostel in Fredericton, New Brunswick without much notion of why I was there, apart from the fact that I was a traveller and that I wanted to travel.

“What on earth are you doing in Fredericton on Christmas Eve?”

The hostel manager was clearly surprised to find anyone stumbling into this small maritime Canadian town in the Christmas season.  He caught me off guard.  Really, what was I doing there on Christmas Eve?  Just as he had promised, the whole town literally closed down after 4pm (I barely made it to the grocery store to stock up), and for the next few days, everything was closed.  Even Tim Hortons (the Canadian response to Starbucks).  I spent Christmas Eve at a service in a local church, watched Sound of Music on TV, and had canned food for dinner.

Lonely?  Certainly.  But there was something exhilarating about that trip seven years ago, the first time I picked up my backpack and went on the road (my friends from Hopkins, if you remember, you all feared for my life and thought I was come to back as a decapitated corpse): it was the satisfaction of exploring the unknown and doing what I had wanted to do.  My big Canadian maritime adventure might not have been Marco Polo’s trip to Asia or Henry Morton Stanley’s exploration expeditions in Africa, but it fulfilled a romantic childhood dream of visiting all those provinces out east in the Canadian maritimes that seemed like neverland to us Vancouverites (maybe it was just me) when I learned Canadian geography in elementary school.  It was about experiencing to its fullest all those dots on the maps that stood out like stars to me – their food, their culture, their people, their public transport … even their freezing cold weather.

And I don’t seem to be ever short of these dreams.

Since then, my travels have always took on that nonchalant nature – hit those points that genuinely excite me, and experience what might come (be it a mugging in La Victoria in Lima, which in hindsight, really was quite stupid, but makes a good story – I have learned to be much wiser since then).  My good friend P described it quite aptly in her photoblog, “Be a traveler, not a tourist.”

Recently, on my vacation to Cape Town, I rented a car and drove up north along the west coast to a small village called Paternoster.  “Why would you want to go there?” the hotel receptionist asked me, somewhat aghast that anyone would want to go to a small town in the middle of nowhere.  In the same vein as the day I arrived in freezing Fredericton, I thought to myself, “because that dot on the map appealed to me.”  And it did (though, arguably, Paternoster is farmore pleasant than Fredericton in freezing winter).

Because of this somewhat “unorthodox” nature of my trips, I always end up travelling alone.  Truth be told, I do have a preference for solo travelling, but only because a trip with the “wrong” companion(s) always end up becoming more about the companion than the place, and that seems to drift away from the usual objective of my voyages to “experience” and “discover” a place.  Lately, however, I have started to think that certain close friends of mine would make fantastic travel companions.  S was one of those friends I had in mind.

So, one day, I asked him casually online, “Why do we never travel together?”

“Because you always prefer travelling alone!”

Not entirely true, I thought.  Yes, I certainly prefer travelling alone than going on a trip with just any person.  But surely, I would go on a trip with a friend of similar disposition in a heartbeat.  Then, I thought, well, duh, because I am here in the Congo pretty much in the middle of nowhere.

Maybe it is because of this increasing frustration that all my social connections have turned virtual (online), that after almost 2.5 years in the Congo, I have really started to itch.  Or maybe it is because of those travel dreams that I never fail to generate (wikitravel.org is a good source) that has started making me itch for the next adventure.

I never anticipated myself to be here for that long, but life has its ways with its twists and turns.  And I can’t complain.  I am learning a great deal in my current job from an industry that is drastically different from the previous.  I have good vacation.  I no longer live in a cave with neither electricity nor running water.  I am paving way for things that I want to do with my life later (although, do I really know what I want to do with my life at the age of 25?).

But the fact is that I have struggled with words the past 9 months since I moved to Katanga, southern Congo.  In a previous update, if you remember, I mentioned that I used to think in paragraphs, especially when I am on the road.  I used to write passages in my head in hopes that I would not forget them when I actually reach a computer or have a pen.  Yet, the past months, I have failed even to produce a single word on paper – hence the silence since my last update.  Maybe it is the monotony.  Maybe it is being bogged down with the tedious nature of administration and bureaucracy.  Maybe it is getting too used to an environment.  Or maybe it is just the lack of an adventure.  Whatever it maybe, I am in need of a new inspiration.

I apologize as this post seems to have deviated quite far from the original nature of “Update from the Field” (I know, there isn’t a single story from the DRC!).  I might as well just call this post “End of year ruminations”.  I could have written about the recent Congolese elections and my thoughts on it, but that would have just given this piece a political nature that I didn’t want for these personal reflections.  I could probably have shared more about working in the private sector in the Congo or about working on a truly innovative and exciting initiative, but like I said, I seem to be at lost with words.  I apologize.

2010 was a year of learning and challenge when I moved from Kinshasa to Goma and then to Dungu.
2011 was a year of change and rehabilitation as I switched from emergency relief to development in the private sector, and saw myself go from a close mental exhaustion to being slowly “nursed” back to some kind of normality (although, what is normal, really?).

What does 2012 hold?  One can only wait and see.

Wish you all a very blessed and fruitful 2012.

PS: In the grand tradition of visiting some kind of “heritage” site or landmark towards the end of the year each year, I share with you photos from Cape Point, Cape of Good Hope, and Cape Agulhas (the actual southernmost tip of Africa) (and a photo of Paternoster; unfortunately, I have lost all the photos from that first backpacking trip I ever made).
