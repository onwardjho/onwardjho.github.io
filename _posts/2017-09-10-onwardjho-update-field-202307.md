Update from the Field: On Loss, cont’d & Epilogue


Trigger warning: I describe scenes of violence and death and use strong language (including expletives) in some parts. All names have been changed, with the exception of Rebecca, whom I talk about at the end.

Length warning: This piece is incredibly long. It is self-indulgent. You are not obliged to read any of it of course, but I am grateful if you do. This is just my way of sharing with you how things are, because I am so awful at writing otherwise. It is also the last piece in this “Update from the Field” series. If you are receiving this note, it is because either you have received past updates or because I thought of you and felt you might be interested. Don’t feel like you have to write back, but if you do, even a few words, I will be very happy to hear from you.

Seven days after Reza’s sister was killed, he came back to the office. The grief in his eyes was a bottomless depth that I had never seen before. No words of condolences seemed adequate.
