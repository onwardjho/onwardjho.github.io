Shafi Ahmadi, a gregarious man with a round face, runs a barber shop with a blue door next to his house in Bamiyan, Afghanistan. His shop is on the way back to our office/guest house, and I visit him maybe once every one or two months for a trim. Shafi barely speaks English, and my Dari is severely limited to names of vegetables I buy in the market, yet, somehow, we manage to communicate – usually with lots of hand signs and laughter. He laments over my lack of Dari and profusely apologizes for his limited English, to which I respond with profuse apologies of my own. This sequence typically ends with him asking me random words in Chinese: his latest favorite is “shuài,” which translates to handsome from Mandarin. He now comically shouts “Shuài! Shuài!” every time I pass by his shop.
