When I hugged my parents goodbye at the airport in Hong Kong seven years ago, ready to begin a new adventure in my life in the US, I cried.  I cried not because I was sad – in fact, I was ecstatic at the prospect of a new land and of starting my own life – but because change is always difficult and emotional.

Seven years later, I found myself in a very similar situation – tears in my eyes.  Except, this time, there was real sorrow in my heart.

Back in January when I was filling in for my boss as Head of Office in Goma when most expatriates were on Christmas vacation, I had a lot of alone time for self-reflection.  During this time, I arrived at a painstaking realization: I was not happy.  It was an incredibly difficult realization because the work I was doing was what I had always wanted to do.  I also felt that North Kivu had a special place in my heart having studied it in school, read it in articles, and finally having arrived there and been in touch with the people.  Above all, I felt a moral obligation and a personal responsibility to the work I was doing.  It was difficult to realize that I was no longer happy doing what I was doing.

I was unhappy not because I no longer liked the nature of my job – I still loved it, I was still passionate about it, and I still cared. But I felt exhausted and burned out.  When I first arrived at my job in Goma, I was eager, energetic and excited.  I could work 15, 16 hours a day, seven days a week and still felt motivated to do more.  I was eager to learn about everything and anything around me.  I wanted to hear everyone’s stories.  Living in the Congo, we, of course, sacrifice certain things in our lives.  Yet, with that zeal in my new role, nothing that was missing in my life was bothering me.  Then, in January, when a series of events triggered an aching longing in my heart for all the things that were missing in my life, I realized it was time to go.

I loved my work in Dungu.  Dungu was always meant to be difficult – isolated, insecure, logistically complicated in a very complex context – but it was everything I was looking for professionally – a complex emergency in an incredibly challenging and unpredictable context, and an opportunity to be close to the field and communities that we were serving.  It was exactly what that I had hoped for to enrich my professional experience.  Yet, in the ten months I spent in Dungu, I felt unsupported in my work, and I felt that little was done to provide me with an enabling environment that would allow me to fully exercise my primary responsibilities as a Program Manager.  I will not go into the details here, but those of you with whom I talk regularly will know what I am talking about.  Suddenly, with the built up of frustrations at work, everything that was missing in my life became painstakingly apparent.  All the missing things were now bothering me.

So with this realization, I began a quest for a new job, understanding that any job search could take six months or more.  In January, when I was in Kinshasa, I also took the opportunity to announce that I did not want to stay in my current role beyond May (that was when the project would end, though it was almost certain that we would have an extension), and that if there were other opportunities elsewhere in the world with CRS I would be ready and open to consider them.

Life, however, has a funny way of arranging things.  In late January, I received a call from a previous employer who asked if I was interested in returning either for a short-term or a long-term opportunity.  As I had already begun thinking about transitions and next steps, I told them I was open to discussions.  Before I knew it, I was offered a consultancy opportunity in southern Congo where I had worked previously.  And so as I considered my own professional development, my mental well-being, the frustrations at work, and the unique opportunity that was presented before me, I made the incredibly difficult decision of resigning from my position with CRS.

When I first took up my role in Dungu, I had every intention of seeing it through and even possibly staying beyond the length of the original project.  I am not a person who easily gives up.  Having started our operations in Dungu, it was difficult personally to recognize that it was time for me to go.  I strongly felt that North Kivu and Haut Uélé were incredibly special places having personally seen the terror in the eyes of those who had just escaped from the LRA or the suffering of Kivuians walking miles and miles fleeing from their villages.  I felt incredibly invested and a strong sense of moral obligation and personal responsibility to our beneficiaries.  I regret not being able to see to the end of our activities under our current grant, but at the same time, I felt that I no longer had the energy to fight for my basic needs that would allow me to carry out my role.

Very few moments in my life have I truly felt sad, but this was unfortunately one of them.

The most difficult part was sharing the news with people with whom I truly enjoyed working.  I felt an incredible sense of guilt towards the camaraderie we had built.  Alas, there is a time for everything.  When friends I made in Goma and Dungu began to leave one by one, I knew that there was a time for departure as well.

My last weeks in Dungu and Goma were hectic ones as it had been all throughout.  As I had wished to leave in the most responsible manner possible, I chose to stay until the end of our seed & tool distributions in early March.  This meant, however, that on top of the handover for which I needed to prepare, I had to organize and complete our distributions – always an incredibly labor-intensive process.  It was a tough time, but knowing that I had a clear objective in mind and an end date in front of me, I felt strengthened, and felt even more obligated to ensure that our interventions were of quality.  I wanted to prove that I was walking away responsibly.

In four days, my team in Dungu efficiently completed the distribution of agriculture kits to 1,500 household beneficiaries.  Our operations were smoother than our previous distributions, and everyone understood their roles much better than the last.  Seeing that a team I had worked with for ten months had increased their capacity was a comforting note to end on.

At my goodbye party with our staff in Goma, I cried as each staff shared their words with me.  And on the same night when I was out with my colleagues for a goodbye drink, I cried again as I shared with my boss the first time in an honest manner the reason I resigned.  It was cathartic letting the sorrow of departure flow out freely from my heart, but I know that I will always miss the wonderful times I had shared with the great people I met in Goma and Dungu, the beautifulrolling hills of Masisi, the enchanting Lake Kivu and volcanoes of the Kivus, the simplicity of life in Dungu…

At the same party, I said, with all sincerity, that as North Kivu had such a special place in my heart, I know I would come back some day. And I meant what I said.

I recently came across a song with lyrics that really described my state of mind during my last days before departure:

Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I’m through with playing by the rules
Of someone else’s game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It’s time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap!

It’s time to try
Defying gravity
I think I’ll try
Defying gravity

On this note, I end my last Update from the Field on my adventures with CRS in conflict-ridden parts of the Congo.  I thank all the great friends who were by my side during all these times in Goma and Dungu, particularly to friends who supported me through all the frustrations in Dungu – the very generous friends of Solidarités who hosted me my whole time in Dungu, friends of our “BOA” (Burnt Out Anonymous), etc. Without you all, I would not have made it that far in Dungu, and CRS would have never been able to implement its project in Haut Uélé.

I have settled into my consultancy well and am slowly getting used to the transition.  The next time I write I should be bringing stories from the corporate world in Katanga.  But I know well that I am humanitarian at heart.

Best,

Joseph

PS: Here is a shameless pitch for myself – I am on the job market again!  I have project management experience in humanitarian and development aid, mostly in food security but also with exposure to protection issues.  My strengths are in monitoring and evaluation, humanitarian operational systems and community engagements.  I enjoy challenges and complex contexts, and particularly enjoy starting things from scratch!  I also have experience in the corporate world in developing countries.  I have a strong political science and economics background from my studies.  If you come across anything that you feel might suit me, please do let me know!!
