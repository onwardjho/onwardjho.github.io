“…Pero el fin de año no representa únicamente una excelente instancia del reunión, sino también un período de reflexión, en cual “nos permitimos” replantearnos y en ocasiones comenzar de cero…En tiempos de “hiperconectividad,” nos resulta cada vez más difícil hacer esa valiosa pausa y detenernos un momento para pensar sobre lo que hemos hecho este año, qué aprendimos de cara al próximo y qué queremos hacer. Es cierto que este 2015 que termina seguramente será recordado por muchos de ustedes como un año difícil…pero al momento de hacer esta reflexión personal, vale la pena conectarnos con lo que realmente queremos vivir y lograr, destacando los momentos positivos, únicos e irrepetibles.”

“But for the end of the year isn’t just an excellent time for get-togethers, it’s also a time for reflection, when we allow ourselves to reassess where we are and – sometimes – to start over from scratch…In these days of “hyperconnectivity,” it has become increasingly difficult to take this valuable break and stop for a moment to contemplate what we’ve done during the year, what we’ve learned and what we want to try for the first time as we face the coming year. While 2015 may have been difficult…after some personal reflection, it’s exceedingly worthwhile to connect with how we really want to live and what we want to achieve, with a special focus on the positive and unique moments of the past year.”
 
I don’t usually pay much attention to airplane magazines, but my Spanish instructor, before I left for my month-long trip, told me to “read anything and everything in Spanish that I put my hands on.” So as I was on my way to Ushuaia, I flipped open the LAN magazine and read this surprisingly thoughtful preface. In January of this year, I decided that I was ready for another career change, hence 2015 was a year of a lot of waiting, searching, and a bit of angst…all of which made it easy to forget the many good moments there were. And so in the spirit of this thoughtful passage, here is my “Best of 2015”:
- Most powerful book I read: Mountains Beyond Mountains, by Tracy Kidder.
- Most intelligent book I read: The Origins of Political Order, by Francis Fukuyama.
- Longest road trip: Phoenix to San Francisco, 11 hours, 732 miles.
- Best US campsite visited: Monument Valley, Arizona.
- Best movie watched: Sergio.
- Best heart-to-heart nerd conversation: with Elizabeth M in DC, May 2015.
- Best track: When We Were Young, 25, Adele.
- Most repeated track: Dirty Paws, Of Monsters & Men (thanks to Simon A, am completely addicted to the song).
- Best night of dancing: At Emily & Steve D’s wedding, April 2015, Denton, TX.
- Carbon footprint: 43 legs of flights
- Number of new countries: 4 (Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) - Longest consecutive # days in Phoenix: 57 days
- Shortest consecutive # days in Phoenix: 11 days (two times)

Best moments:
- January: 3.5 weeks in Yogjakarta for Bahasa Indonesia language immersion where I met some really great folks – Berlin, Ridha, Febrian, Anggun, Daniel, Belinda – and gained a new found appreciation of Indonesia’s diversity and its fantastic (-ally good humoured) people.

- February: First time in a decade our whole family celebrated Chinese New Year together. In a very serendipitous way, we all found ourselves in London (I was in transit to the Congo and spent a night there, my parents were visiting my brother) and managed to have Chinese New Year dinner together.

- March: Celebrated my birthday for the fifth time in the DRC (and hopefully the last) with some of my favorite people in Katanga – Caitlin H, Brieuc D.

- April: 4 flights, 3 days & 2 continents, made it to Clifford L’s big day with Hiromi. Got embarrassingly smashed one night, but had a pretty amazing time getting together with the old Hopkin’s crew, some of whom I haven’t seen since graduation.

- April: Made it back to the US in time to be part of Emily & Steve D’s big day in Denton, and met also made some good new friends: Joelle, Mwikali, Cecily, Suzanne.

- May: Reconnected with some of the best people in my life of whom I just don’t see enough while I was in DC for a conference – Elizabeth M, Anna Y, Jiehae C, etc. Also caught up with Rachel U, Brieuc D, Philippe R & Severine A in NYC on my way to Lima!

- June: Revisited Arequipa, this time for work, and met some incredibly sharp Peruvian colleagues tackling challenging and complex social and political issues. Also had my favorite chupe de camarones from its origin again and finally saw condors in Colca Canyon this time.

- July: Had the rare opportunity to visit Afghanistan for two weeks. Although I decided not to work there in the end, I left with a deep appreciation of the country and its people…and I certainly hope there will be another chance to work with Jasmine B again in the future!

- July: After months and months of stop-and-go, I took three of my favorite Congolese colleagues to visit our Indonesian operations as part of staff capacity building and intra-company exchange. Thanks to my excellent Indonesian colleagues, especially Jerry S and Reza S, the trip was a success and I left Indonesia feeling a sense of “a job well-done”. We celebrated Idul Fitri together and stuffed ourselves silly in six rounds of eating at various colleagues’ houses.

- July: Surprised my dad and showed up at his 60th birthday celebration in China.

- August: Bryan C came to visit and we had fun catching up, hiking, and camping. He gave me an excuse to revisit some of my favorite spots in Arizona – Horseshoe Bend & Flagstaff – before leaving for good.

- August: Finally threw in the towel and decided to leave Phoenix after months and months of thinking. Grateful for the opportunity and work experience, but the two years have been difficult on many levels. Thank you Matt S for keeping me sane the past two years.

- September: On Thursday, Goodwill came to pick up the last of my belongings. I finished packing in the night, loaded all my suitcases into the car, slept on the floor, and went to work on Friday. Friday noon, I returned my apartment keys, went back to work, and at 4pm, I packed up my desk and waved goodbye to Phoenix with my life in a car.

- September: Eleen S & Kitty Lihosted me for a lovely week in San Francisco as I tied up loose ends and caught up with some lovelies – Victoria C, Jaclyn L, James T, James G, Pauline C, Bryce C, Joseph L, Madonna L, Samantha K, Benjamin K.

- October: Back in Vancouver first time in a decade and retraced my childhood footsteps with my parents. I hiked, ate good food, and just generally had a sweet time.

- October: Saw Iguazu Falls, met Jorge P, and just generally had a great time in Brazil.

- November: After an aborted attempt three years ago, I finally made it to Buenos Aires. Spent a month in this fantastic city to work on my Spanish and thoroughly fell in love with it. I will be back for more in 2016!

- December: A last minute decision to trek Torres del Paine proved to be the best decision ever. Possibly one of the most satisfying treks I have done and the sight of Torres at sunrise was one of the most moving experiences ever. Grateful to have met Simon A, the best hiking buddy. Hope to see each other again before the trip ends, but if not, looking forward to visiting Paris and other trekking adventures in the future!

For those of you I didn’t get to see in 2015, I hope there will be a chance for us to reconnect in person in 2016. Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!
